  'description': '<p>Show No Mercy is the debut studio album by American thrash metal band Slayer, released in December 1983 through Metal Blade Records. Brian Slagel signed the band to Metal Blade after watching the band perform the song "Phantom of the Opera" by Iron Maiden. The band self-financed their debut album, combining the savings of vocalist Tom Araya, who was employed as a respiratory therapist, and money borrowed from guitarist Kerry King\'s father.</p> <p>Touring extensively promoting the album, the band brought close friends and family members along the trip, who helped backstage with lighting and sound. Although criticized for poor production quality, it became Metal Blade Records\' highest selling release, also producing the songs "Die by the Sword", "The Antichrist" and "Black Magic", which are played at Slayer\'s live shows regularly.</p>'

  'description': '<p>Hell Awaits is the second studio album by American thrash metal band Slayer, released through Metal Blade Records in 1985. The band\'s previous release, Show No Mercy, became Metal Blade Records\' highest selling release; as a result, producer Brian Slagel desired to release a second Slayer album. To that end, Slagel financed a recording budget (Show No Mercy was paid for by band members) and recruited several experienced producers to help in the studio.</p><p>Lyrical themes on Hell Awaits include hell and Satan, as their debut. The intro of the first track "Hell Awaits" played backwards reveals the repeated phrase "join us".[4] Musically, the album features the band\'s most progressive and diverse work compared to their previous releases, and according to Kerry King, he and Jeff Hanneman were very into Mercyful Fate at the time, which then led to the longer and more progressive songs.[5] Defined as "influential to future extreme metal acts," the most popular songs from Hell Awaits were re-recorded by various underground metal bands and have appeared on several tribute albums.</p>'

  'description': '<p>Reign in Blood is the third studio album and major label debut by American thrash metal band Slayer. It was released on October 7, 1986, on Def Jam Recordings.[1] The album was the band\'s first collaboration with record producer Rick Rubin, whose input helped the band\'s sound evolve. Reign in Blood was well received by both critics and fans, and was responsible for bringing Slayer to the attention of a mainstream metal audience. Kerrang! magazine described the record as "the heaviest album of all". Alongside Anthrax\'s Among the Living, Megadeth\'s Peace Sells... but Who\'s Buying? and Metallica\'s Master of Puppets, Reign in Blood helped define the sound of the emerging US thrash metal scene in the mid-1980s, and has remained influential subsequently.</p><p>Reign in Blood\'s release was delayed because of concerns regarding its graphic artwork and lyrical subject matter. The opening track, "Angel of Death", which refers to Josef Mengele and describes acts, such as human experimentation, that Mengele committed at the Auschwitz concentration camp, provoked allegations of Nazism.[2] However, the band stated numerous times that it does not condone Nazism, and are merely interested in the subject.[3] The album was Slayer\'s first to enter the Billboard 200; the release peaked at #94, and was certified Gold on November 20, 1992.</p>',

  'description': '<p>South of Heaven is the fourth studio album by American thrash metal band Slayer. Released on July 5, 1988, the album was the band\'s second collaboration with record producer Rick Rubin, whose production skills on Slayer\'s previous album Reign in Blood had helped the band\'s sound evolve.</p><p>South of Heaven was Slayer\'s second album to enter the Billboard 200, and its last to be released by Def Jam Recordings, although the album became an American Recordings album after Rick Rubin ended his partnership with Russell Simmons. It was one of only two Def Jam titles to be distributed by Geffen Records through Warner Bros. Records because of original distributor Columbia Records\' refusal to release work by the band. The release peaked at number 57 and in 1992 was awarded a gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America.</p><p>In order to offset the pace of the group\'s previous album, Slayer deliberately slowed down the album\'s tempo. In contrast to their previous albums, the band utilized undistorted guitars and toned-down vocals. While some critics praised this musical change, others more accustomed to the style of earlier releases were disappointed. The songs "Mandatory Suicide" and the title track, however, have become permanent features of the band\'s live setlist.</p>',
